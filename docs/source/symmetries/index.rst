This module contains the main functions to extract the QMB state configurations of a given symmetry sector resulting 
from multiple Abelian U(1) or Z(2) local and global symmetries of the QMB Hamiltonian

The pages below cover configuration generation, global and link symmetry
filters, sparse operator kernels in symmetry-reduced bases, and the combined
symmetry-sector builders.
